		<div class="text">
			<h2>Before You Begin Changing Your Eating Habit</h2>
			<p>First of all, pause, and appreciate yourself for trying again.
				This is probably not your first try to eat Healthily, and definitely not your first attempt at trying to
				change your relationship with food. And that's OK.</p>
			<h2>LET IT GO</h2>
			<p>You are not your past. You are not your failures. And you are not your eating habits. In fact - LET IT
				GO!
				All that stuff is just a bag of rocks weighing you down. So let's put it aside (you can always pick it
				up
				again later if you really want to).</p>
			<h2>BREATHE</h2>
			<p>Slow down and take a deep breath in. And on the exhale, release your shoulders. Watch as the knots of
				stress
				and anxiety slowly unravel and melt away. If you're not smiling, you can smile now :D</p>
			<h2>YOU DO YOU</h2>
			<p>Now doesn't that feel better? The lightness of being you. You! It feels good to just be you. And that's
				what
				this is all about. It's about you.</p>
