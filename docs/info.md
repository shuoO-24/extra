Mindful eating is maintaining an in-the-moment awareness of the food and drink you put into your body. It involves observing how the food makes you feel and the signals your body sends about taste, satisfaction, and fullness. Mindful eating requires you to simply acknowledge and accept rather than judge the feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations you observe. It can extend to the process of buying, preparing, and serving your food as well as consuming it.

Mindful eating isn't about being perfect, always eating the right things, or never allowing yourself to eat on-the-go again. And it's not about establishing strict rules for how many calories you can eat or which foods you have to include or avoid in your diet. Rather, it's about focusing all your senses and being present as you shop for, cook, serve, and eat your food.

While mindfulness isn't for everyone, many people find that by eating this way, even for just a few meals a week, you can become more attuned to your body. This can help you to avoid overeating, make it easier to change your dietary habits for the better, and enjoy the improved well-being that comes with a healthier diet.

# How to fit mindful eating into your life

Fundamentally, mindful eating involves:

- eating slowly and without distraction 
- listening to physical hunger cues and eating only until you're full
- distinguishing between true hunger and non-hunger triggers for eating
- engaging your senses by noticing colors, smells, sounds, textures, and flavors
- learning to cope with guilt and anxiety about food
- eating to maintain overall health and well-being
- noticing the effects food has on your feelings and figure
- appreciating your food

# The Mindful Eating Cycle

Am I hungry?

That's the question Dr. Michelle May wants you to ask yourself. She's seen people suffer from unhealthy relationships with food and overly restrictive diets, and she put together a framework for mindful eating that can help people rethink the way they eat.

Dr. May coined the term "The Mindful Eating Cycle" and used it as the basis of her *Am I Hungry? Mindful Eating Program* (May, 2018).

Here's the full cycle:

1. Why? Why do I eat?
2. When? When do I want to eat?
3. What? What do I want to eat?
4. How? How do I eat?
5. How Much? How much do I eat?
6. Where? Where do I invest my energy?

Let's dive into this cycle and flesh out the questions that guide you at each step.

## Why do I eat?

- Why do I think I eat?
- Am I really aware of all the situations and/or emotions that trigger me to want to eat when I'm not hungry?

- Have I tried a lot of diets? What happened? How did they work for me long term? Why?

## When do I eat?

- How often do I feel like eating? Why?
- How do I know if I'm hungry?
- Can I tell the difference between physical hunger and head hunger?
- How could I redirect my attention away from food until I'm hungry?
- What could I do to cope better with my emotional triggers for eating when I'm not hungry?
- When does "I want a brownie" really mean "I want a break"?

## What do I eat?

## How much do I eat?

- How do I feel when I'm done eating?
- Do I like the way I feel?
- Do I feel compelled to clean my plate?
- If I'm not hungry when I start eating, how do I know when to stop?
- What situations or emotions trigger me to overeat?
- What could I do to address my triggers for overeating more effectively?
- What do I do after those times I eat too much anyway?

## Where do I invest the energy I consume?

- Am I physically active?
- Do I watch too much TV or spend too much free time in front of the computer?
- How do I feel about exercise?
- Do I exercise? What do I like to do?
- Do I use exercise to punish myself for eating or to earn the right to eat?
- What else do I do with my energy (i.e. play with my children; work on my hobbies; volunteer; travel; spend time with friendsâ€¦)?
- Is there anything else I'd like to do that I'm not doing now?
- What are my goals for my relationships, my career, and my life?
- Do I practice regular and meaningful self-care in order to buffer myself from life stress?
- Does my life reflect wellness and wholeness in body, mind, heart, and spirit?

Asking yourself questions such as these can help you break any unhealthy eating cycles you have and replace them with a healthy mindful eating cycle. Instead of counting calories and worrying about what you eat, you can build a positive and enjoyable relationship with food, leading to a happier and healthier you.
