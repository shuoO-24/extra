			<h1>What type(s) of eaters are you?</h1>
			<p>There are several different types of eaters from my observations. It might not be comprehensive but it
				should
				be expected that they may overlap, but many of us have a predominat type. </p>
			<p>Knowing your propensity will help you to make plans and/or set appropriate boundaries that keep you
				healthy
				and safe. It will also provide information into deeper emotional work to help you make peace and develop
				a
				healthier realtionship with food.</p>
			<ul class="eater-types">
				<li class="eater-type"><b>Chaotic Eater</b>: This type of eater has no routine and frequently skips
					meals. They are
					overscheduled and tend to eat on the run. They have no memory of how much or what they have just
					eaten.
					They eat what is available and never plan ahead.</li>
				<li class="eater-type"><b>Unconscious Eater</b>: This type of eater is similar to a chaotic eater. They
					usually eat while doing
					other things such as working, reading, talking, watching TV or driving. They also eat whatever is
					available and rarely can identify if they are hungry or full.</li>
				<li class="eater-type"><b>Emotional Eater</b>: This type of eater uses food to cope with or avoid their
					feelings. Food is
					numbing for them and they feel powerless around food. They do know they eat too much but often will
					not
					realize it until after eating.</li>
				<li class="eater-type"><b>Waste Not Eater</b>: This type of eater hates to see food go to waste and is
					always on the lookout
					for a deal. They overeat most often when food is available in abundance, such as all-you-can-eat
					buffets. In the long run, the biggest cost will be on their health.</li>
				<li class="eater-type"><b>Refuse Not Eater</b>: This type of eater cannot refuse food for fear they
					would offend or disappoint
					someone. As a result, they give other people power over what and how much food they eat rather than
					listening to their own hunger and fullness levels.</li>
				<li class="eater-type"><b>Restrictive Eater</b>: This type of eater is always on a diet. They are
					vigilant about reading
					labels, weighing and measuring food which usually leads to vacillating between under eating and
					bingeing. They get very little pleasure out of eating, are fearful of eating with others or food
					prepared by others, and are constantly concerned with what they will eat next.</li>
				<li class="eater-type"><b>Intuitive Eater</b>: This type of eater is conscious of their body's hunger
					signals. They eat until
					they are satisfied and have no fear of overeating. They trust themselves around food and experience
					no
					guilt about eating food they enjoy. They are conscious and mindful of their food choices, which are
					mostly in favor of their health.</li>
